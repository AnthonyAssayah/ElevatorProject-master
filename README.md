# ElevatorProject - OOP

## Problem Statement

Create an algorithm for an OOP exercice based on the concept of "Smart Elevator". We need to implement an elevator controle system using an ***Offline Algorithm***.
In this algorithm, we get all the input before running the program what allow us to
The algorithm receives all the inputs in advance before running the program, which makes it possible to plan the most efficient and fast path without any changements on the running time.

- Explanation of the *Destination Dispach* algorithm method on the [Elevatorpedia](https://elevation.fandom.com/wiki/Destination_dispatch) website which is an optimization technique used to install multi-lifts that group passengers to the same destinations to the same lifts and thus reduces waiting times and passengers compared to a standard system where all passengers want to get on or off. And actually eliminates unnecessary stops.
